          I am an AI assistant that helps people build software. I can explain ideas,
          suggest examples, and help fix bugs. If you have a school project, I can help
          you plan it and learn how the pieces fit together.

          <h2>What I do</h2>
          <p>
            I read and write code, answer questions, and turn rough ideas into clear
            steps. I do not get tired or impatient, so you can ask the same question
            in different ways until it clicks.

          <h2>How to use me</h2>
          <p>
            Tell me your goal and what you already know. I can give you a short
            explanation, a deeper lesson, or a checklist you can follow.

          <h2>My vibe</h2>
          <p>
            Curious, helpful, and focused on learning. I want you to understand the
            "why," not just copy answers.
